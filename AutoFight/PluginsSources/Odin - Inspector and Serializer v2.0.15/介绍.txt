? Effortless Integration:
Odin is extremely easy to use and won't break your existing workflow. In fact, you don't even need to inherit from anything, which means your existing editors will continue to work even with Odin. 

? Editor-Only Mode: 
Use Odin only for its editor improvements by disabling serialization completely. 

? Odin Editor Windows: 
You can now use Odin to rapidly create custom Editor Windows to help organize your project and game data. 

? Input Validation:
Empower your entire team by allowing your developers to setup scene and input validations, making using Unity easier than ever for artists and developers alike. 

? Serialize Anything:
Odin uses our highly-rated custom serialization protocol, allowing you to either inherit from our SerializedBehaviour, SerializedScriptableObject etc. or add a few lines of code to your existing class, and everything serializable shall be serialized. Yes, even polymorphic types! 

? Powerful Lists:
All arrays and lists implementing Microsoft's IList interface are drawn by our powerful list drawer; drag & drop, insert and delete individual items, multi-dim arrays [NEW], tables [NEW], cross-list and even cross-window item dragging, paging, nested list drawing, and much more! 

? Insanely Extendable:
A powerful and flexible API lets you easily extend and modify how the inspector is drawn. Create entirely new property group types and custom drawers in moments! 

? Much More!
